NOTES

* a physics world is defined in 'worlds.ss', including object masses, types,
force-fields, global forces, etc. The particular world defined here is 
pushed as the 'real-world' to physics-main.

* physics-main.ss at the moment only generates the observed-path in a 
forward direction from some randomly selected initial conditions. It 
saves the output (real-world q0 v0 observed-path) into a file in the
worlds/ directory. The observed-path along with data for python display
is saved in a pythonphysics/stimuli directory.

* actual inference is run in 'run-inference.ss' which loads a world
from the worlds directory, along with initial conditions and the actual
path. This is then handed to a loop which goes over all the parameters
to be inferred, and all combinations of these parameters. 

* At the moment, the particles do take into account the fact that if there
are objects of the same color then they should have the same mass.

TODO - make this the case for particle field-parameters and goo-strength.

* For each parameter setting simulate-and-score function creates an 
artificial world with settings that match the real world in terms of 
color, goo location, initial parameters and other observables. The hidden
parameters are passed in through a loop. The output is a score calculated
by comparing the simulated path to the real one.

* TODO make the output of the simulated a bit more readable for python, 
and take into account the fact that we're inferring over a whole lot of
things -> masses, field-parameters, fields, goo-strength, global-forces.
